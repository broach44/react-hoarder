# React Hoarder

## Description
This app is a simple collection of a users stuff.  This application is my first adventure on my own into React routing.  It features full CRUD on a single collection.  The user is able to add, delete and update their stuff in their collection from two different locations.  They can interact with their collection from a list view.  They can also interact with the collection when viewing a single item.
## Technologies Used
- React
- React Routing
- Sass
- Bootstrap
